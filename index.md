LodIDE provides an online development environment to more easily get 
started using Linked Open Data (LOD).

Check it out online at [lodide.io](http://lodide.io) or get the sources at
[github.com/edulod/lodide](https://github.com/edulod/lodide).

LodIDE is best used with some familiarity with JavaScript and with the basic
concepts of Linked Data and RDF. There are many resources on the web to get 
started programming JavaScript. The [Euclid Project](http://www.euclid-project.eu/)
provides a free curriculum for Linked Data which is ideal to be used as complement 
to the experimentation framework and exercises provided by LodIDE.
